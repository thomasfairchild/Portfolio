## Project Description

This project will become my personal website that will showcase my web design portfolio and Movie/Photo VFX skills. It's a work in progress. It will be updated the more I learn. I hope my first website demonstrates my web-making skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, etc.) and Visual Effects capabilities (movie-making, photography, etc.)

## YouTube Video Links

I'll be embedding links to YouTube videos I've made that show off my VFX skills.

## Wireframes

It's my intention to make my website look identical whether it's being seen on a Mobile deice or Desktop, with a few tweaks in resolution if necessary.
