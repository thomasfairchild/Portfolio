## Project Description

This project will become my personal website that will showcase my web design portfolio and Movie/Photo VFX skills. It's a work in progress. It will be updated the more I learn. I hope my first website demonstrates my web-making skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, etc.) and Visual Effects capabilities (movie-making, photography, etc.)

## YouTube Video Links

I'll be embedding links to YouTube videos I've made that show off my VFX skills.

## Wireframes

It's my intention to make my website look identical whether it's being seen on a Mobile deice or Desktop, with a few tweaks in resolution if necessary.

## Issues and Resolutions

October 9th:

-Organized basic HTML layout

-Designed the main banner for the header.

October 11th:

-Found a really cool CSS Gradient site that helped give the PERFECT
background color for my navigation bar and the overall look of the site.

-Managed to get the nav buttons to look right.

-Working on getting text over the aboutme image background.

-Getting the Web Designs (General Assembly class projects)
layout prepared.

October 12th:

-With Adobe After Effects/Photoshop, the main banner has been converted into a gif.

-HTML/CSS Layout nearing completion.

-Goal is to organize things and set up the Mobile/Desktop settings.

-Through Adobe Stock, I acquired the license to select social media icons (Gmail, YouTube, Twitter, etc.)

-Revised the social media icons in Adobe Photoshop.

-Carefully organized all the divs.

-Configured ALL the Media settings.

October 13th:

-Today's goal is to use jQuery/Ajax to play quotes over an image.

-Goal remains incomplete. Requested and received assistance from an instructor--very helpful; however, more remains to be done.

October 14th:

-Due to complications, I'll have to improvise. Instead of using jQuery/Ajax to
generate a random quote, I decided to simply add one that matters to me.

-Update: I challenged myself and made a quotesArray in Javascript. Now I have a random quote generator.

-After several bug fixes/adjustments, I'm happy with how things have turned out!
